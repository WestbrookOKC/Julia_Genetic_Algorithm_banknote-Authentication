# Julia_Genetic_Algorithm_banknote-Authentication

Datasets: https://datahub.io/machine-learning/banknote-authentication

I split the dataset into two CSV files, one for real banknotes and one for counterfeit banknotes, for easy classification. You can download my classified dataset directly

V1. variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)

V2. skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)

V3. curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)

V4. entropy of image (continuous)


Class (target). Presumably 1 for genuine and 2 for forged
